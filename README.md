# **Welcome to my Twitter Scarapper application**

- #### _In this program I am using snscape library in python, this library is used to scrape data from social media applications like Twitter, FaceBook, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram etc._

- #### _In this program I am focusing on Twitter, I used TwitterSearchScraper function to scrape twitter details such as date, username, id, tweet, retweet, like and comment counts etc, using this function the program can search user, hashtag or event with only one function._

- #### _After scraping the data I used pandas library to store the data as DataFrame, in Data Science world Dataframe is the commonly used datatype as it is easy to store and visualize the data as table format in the program_

- #### _This program is visualised using GUI called streamlit, streamlit is also a python library used to give graphical interface for the user in browser webpage_

- #### _After the result is stored as DataFrame the data is not permanently stored in the system, when the program is closed the search result is deleted from the RAM, to store the search result permanently with user's approval I used MongoDB server to store the data locally_
